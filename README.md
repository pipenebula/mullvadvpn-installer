# mullvadvpn-installer
ï»¿# Introduction

Tired installing *AUR* helpers just because *of one app*?
*Uh, you are non-arch/non-systemd user?*

There are unofficial **Mullvad VPN** auto-installer written in Go for you! 
**Supports all distributions and all init-systems**.

# Why not "official" installer? ( AUR )

"Official" one just unpacks .deb ( AppImage ), moves files into dirs and setups systemd service.

This one does the same work, but its written in Go ( automatically superior ), have some more features and supports all init systems.
